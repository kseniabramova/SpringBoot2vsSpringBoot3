# Differences Between Spring Boot 2 and Spring Boot 3

This document outlines the key differences between **Spring Boot 2** and **Spring Boot 3**, including updated features, Java version requirements, and other important changes.

## 1. Java Version Support
- **Spring Boot 2**: Supports **Java 8** and **Java 11**.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Requires **Java 17** or higher, benefiting from new performance and security improvements in the latest LTS release.

## 2. Kotlin Support
- **Spring Boot 2**: Supported **Kotlin** from version 1.3.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Officially supports **Kotlin 1.6** and above, providing better performance and access to the latest language features.

## 3. Jakarta EE Support
- **Spring Boot 2**: Uses **Java EE** (e.g., `javax` packages).
- **Spring Boot 3**: Migrates to **Jakarta EE**, with all Java EE-related packages now in the `jakarta` namespace. This requires refactoring of any `javax`-based code.

## 4. Spring Framework Version
- **Spring Boot 2**: Based on **Spring Framework 5.x**.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Upgraded to **Spring Framework 6**, featuring API enhancements, optimizations, and better support for **reactive programming**.

## 5. AOT (Ahead-of-Time) Compilation
- **Spring Boot 3**: Introduces support for **GraalVM Native Image**, enabling applications to be compiled into native binaries for faster startup and reduced resource usage.

### GraalVM Overview
**GraalVM** is a versatile virtual machine supporting multiple languages (Java, JavaScript, Python, etc.) with advanced performance optimizations.

- **Native Binary Compilation**: Compile Java applications into native executables, reducing startup time and resource requirements.
- **Polyglot Support**: Seamlessly mix code from different languages within the same application.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Additional optimizations for improved runtime performance.

## 6. Spring Security Updates
- **Spring Boot 2**: Uses **Spring Security 5.x**.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Upgraded to **Spring Security 6**, with redesigned authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Key Differences in Spring Security 6.x
- **Redesigned Configuration**: Transition to `SecurityFilterChain` for more flexible and modern security configurations.
- **Enhanced OAuth2 and OIDC Support**: Improved integration with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
- **Stricter Default Security**: More secure defaults for CSRF protection and other measures.
- **Java Configuration Emphasis**: Simplified configuration using Java-based methods instead of XML.

## 7. Microservices and Cloud Support
- **Spring Boot 3**: Enhanced integration with cloud platforms like **Kubernetes** and **containers**, and improved observability with **Micrometer** and **OpenTelemetry**.

### Key Enhancements in Spring Boot 3
- **Improved Cloud Integration**:
    - **Automatic Service Registration**: Automatic registration of services in **Kubernetes**.
    - **Container Configuration**: Easier setup for **Docker** containers with improved templates.
    - **Cloud Profiles**: Simplified configuration management with cloud-specific profiles.

- **Enhanced Observability**:
    - **Micrometer**: Advanced metrics collection with integration to systems like **Prometheus** and **Datadog**.
    - **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing to track requests across microservices and identify performance bottlenecks.
    - **Centralized Logging**: Better integration with logging systems like **ELK Stack** and **Fluentd**.

## 8. API and Library Updates
**Spring Boot 3** introduces updates to key libraries and enhanced support for reactive programming:

- **Hibernate**: Upgraded for improved performance and new features.
- **Jackson**: Updated for better JSON processing and standards compatibility.
- **Micrometer**: Enhanced for more effective monitoring and performance metrics.

### Improved Reactive Streams Support
- **Reactive Streams**: Better support for reactive programming enables efficient handling of asynchronous and streaming data, enhancing performance and scalability.

## 9. Improved Configuration and Auto-Configuration
**Spring Boot 3** offers enhanced auto-configuration capabilities and more flexible configuration options, making it easier to set up and customize applications without extensive manual configuration.

### Examples:
- **Auto-Configuration for Databases**: Automatically configures databases like H2 without needing manual setup code.
- **Profile Management**: Simplified profile-based configurations allow easy switching between different environments (e.g., development, production).
- **Conditional Bean Registration**: More flexible bean configuration based on conditions, reducing the need for custom configuration code.

For more information on upgrading or using Spring Boot 3, please refer to the [Spring Boot documentation](https://docs.spring.io).
